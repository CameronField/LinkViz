# LinkViz
Link Margin Sensitivity Visualization Tool for Space-Based Mission Architectures

## Overview
LinkViz is an application designed to calculate and visualize link margin sensitivity in decibels, according to user-defined mission requirements. Developed as part of the Aerospace Corporation's Concept Design Center, LinkViz leverages model-based systems engineering and digital engineering to facilitate real-time trade space exploration. It is written in python and built utilizing Dash to streamline the html development.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Interface**: Utilize sliders and dropdowns to customize inputs.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Graphs update instantly as users adjust parameters.
- **Mission-Critical Insights**: Assists communication engineering teams in testing different configurations and feasibility.
